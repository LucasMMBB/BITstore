#VIM TUTORIAL
##Super Basic Starter
There are two modes in vime: COMMAND MODE and INSERT MODE
##Moving the Cursor
-`h`-left
-`k`-Up
-`l`-Right
-`j`-Down
##Exiting Vim
quit: `:q`
quit and discard changes: `:q!`
quit and save changes: `:wq`
##Text Editing - Deletion
use `x` to delete letters in COMMAND MODE, which is more powerful
##Text Exiting - Insertion
`i` puts the cursor before the current position
`a` puts the cursor after the current position
`o` puts the cursor below the line
`O` puts the cursor above the line
##Operators and Motions, Counts, and Combining Them
It's a good idea to learn how commands work, not memorize commands. Commands are broken down into these parts:
- Operator
- Numbers
- Motions
When to put together, the Vim Command will look something like:
```
[OPERATOR][NUMBER][MOTION]
```
