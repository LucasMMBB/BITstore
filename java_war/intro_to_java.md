I didn't use too much Java since i thought it was complex with a lot of syntaxes compared with java. But i am still making this tutorial since no language is perfect and there are for sure a lot of good things in Java

## chapter one: brief introduction
### Set up environment for Java - Java SDK
### First program in java
```java
public class HelloJava{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println("Hello Java");
	}
}
```
In command line, input `javac HelloJava.java` to compile this file and then run this program by inputting `java HelloJava`

## chapter two: Eclipse and IntelliJ
## chapter three: Java structure
